This proof of concept was created and deployed in two hours.
This makes me REALLY proud. All the rest is nothing.
The app itself is REALLY stupid.

== HOW IT WORKS

At the moment, it is a matrix of possible PASTAs and SAUCEs.
Italians are not happy to put any sauce with any pasta, there is a matrix which is coded in our DNA
and non-italians simply have to learn the hard way. My way, maybe :P

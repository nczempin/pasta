This proof of concept was created and deployed in two hours.
This makes me REALLY proud. All the rest is nothing.
The app itself is REALLY simple.

HOW IT WORKS
============

At the moment, it is a matrix of possible PASTAs and SAUCEs.
Italians are not happy to put any sauce with any pasta, there is a matrix which is coded in our DNA
and non-italians simply have to learn the hard way, via this application for instance.

*NOTE*: From this app, you may infer trivially that Spaghetti Bolognese dont exist! - http://www.palladius.it/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=177:spaghetti-bolognese-dont-exist&catid=30:english-contents&Itemid=67

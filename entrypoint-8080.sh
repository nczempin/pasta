# copied/inspired by my `ror6-2020-goldie/entrypoint-8080.sh` under gprojects.

# This is a best practice entrypoint which does two things:
# 1. Preps this shitty ruby1.9 environment.
# 2. Is ready to execute other commands, (say rake db:migrate or something)

# First of all we source .env as we might need to override something.

#
# 2023-01-19 v0.6 added RAILS_ENV to first line.
